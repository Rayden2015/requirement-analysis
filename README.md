# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides concise learning materials and practical resources for performing requirement analysis in software projects. It covers key activities such as eliciting, documenting, validating, and managing requirements, and includes notes, templates (e.g., SRS, user stories, use cases), checklists, and example artifacts to support effective analysis throughout the SDLC.

This are my notes made while following the ALX Course on FrontEnd Development Pro.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of discovering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. Its goal is to ensure a shared, testable understanding of what the system must do and the conditions under which it must operate before (and during) design and implementation.

Key activities typically include:
- Elicitation: Engage stakeholders through interviews, workshops, observation, surveys, and analysis of existing systems.
- Analysis and modeling: Clarify, structure, and prioritize requirements; model with use cases, user stories, workflows, and domain models.
- Specification: Document functional and non-functional requirements in artifacts such as an SRS, user stories with acceptance criteria, and use-case specifications.
- Validation: Review and verify requirements with stakeholders to ensure correctness, completeness, consistency, and feasibility.
- Management and traceability: Control changes, maintain a single source of truth, and trace requirements to design, implementation, and tests.

Why it is important in the SDLC:
- Reduces rework and scope creep by clarifying expectations early and controlling changes.
- Aligns stakeholders by establishing a common language and shared understanding of outcomes.
- Improves planning and estimation by clarifying scope, complexity, and constraints.
- Drives architecture and design decisions by highlighting quality attributes (e.g., performance, security, scalability).
- Increases quality and testability by making requirements verifiable and traceable to test cases.
- Mitigates risks and supports compliance by uncovering constraints (legal, regulatory, operational) before costly development work.

Common deliverables:
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Use-case diagrams and scenarios
- Prototypes or wireframes
- Requirements traceability matrix

When performed:
- Inception and planning: define vision, scope, and high-level needs
- Elaboration and design: refine, model, and validate requirements; manage changes
- Implementation and testing: maintain traceability to code and tests; refine details
- Deployment and maintenance: manage evolving requirements and feedback from production

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Good software rarely happens by accident. Requirement Analysis gives teams a shared map of what to build and why, before they spend time and money writing code. A few reasons it matters so much in the SDLC:

- Clarity and alignment: It turns scattered ideas into clear, testable expectations. Stakeholders, designers, and engineers can all point to the same source of truth and agree on what “done” really means.

- Risk and cost control: The cheapest time to catch misunderstandings is at the start. By validating needs early, teams avoid scope creep, rework, and late surprises that blow up timelines and budgets.

- Better architecture and quality: Understanding performance, security, compliance, and scalability requirements upfront guides sound architectural choices. This leads to systems that are not just functional, but robust under real-world constraints.

- Testability and transparency: Well‑written requirements translate naturally into acceptance criteria and test cases. This tightens feedback loops, improves coverage, and makes progress visible to non-technical stakeholders.

- Sustainable change: As needs evolve, managed requirements and traceability make it possible to assess impact quickly, prioritize with confidence, and update plans without chaos.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- Requirement Gathering:
  - Identify stakeholders (users, sponsors, domain experts, operations, compliance) and existing artifacts (legacy systems, manuals, policies).
  - Establish the project context: goals, scope, constraints, dependencies, and success measures.
  - Capture high-level needs and business outcomes before diving into details.

- Requirement Elicitation:
  - Use interviews, workshops, observation, surveys, document analysis, and prototyping to uncover needs.
  - Ask probing questions to reveal implicit expectations, constraints, and edge cases.
  - Resolve conflicting viewpoints and prioritize what delivers the most value.

- Requirement Documentation:
  - Record functional and non-functional requirements clearly and unambiguously.
  - Use artifacts such as an SRS, user stories with acceptance criteria, use cases, and process flows.
  - Maintain a single source of truth that is versioned, searchable, and accessible to all stakeholders.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
  - Structure and refine requirements, remove ambiguity, and check completeness and consistency.
  - Model behavior and data using use-case diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machines, domain models, and wireframes.
  - Prioritize and decompose requirements into implementable units that align with roadmap and capacity.

- Requirement Validation:
  - Review requirements with stakeholders to verify correctness, feasibility, and testability.
  - Define acceptance criteria and link requirements to test cases for traceability.
  - Pilot or prototype critical flows to de-risk assumptions before full implementation.
