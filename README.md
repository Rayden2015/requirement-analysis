# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides concise learning materials and practical resources for performing requirement analysis in software projects. It covers key activities such as eliciting, documenting, validating, and managing requirements, and includes notes, templates (e.g., SRS, user stories, use cases), checklists, and example artifacts to support effective analysis throughout the SDLC.
This are my notes from made while following the ALX Course on FrontEnd Development Pro.
